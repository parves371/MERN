# MERN Stack Learning Journey

Welcome to my MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack learning journey repository! This repository serves as a central hub for all the projects, code snippets, resources, and progress tracking related to my journey of mastering the MERN stack.

## About the MERN Stack

The MERN stack is a powerful combination of technologies for building modern web applications:
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that provides scalability and flexibility, perfect for storing JSON-like documents.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its component-based architecture and virtual DOM.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, enabling server-side JavaScript execution.

## Repository Structure

- **Projects**: This directory contains subdirectories for individual MERN projects I'm working on. Each project will have its own folder containing the code, and any associated files.
- **Code Snippets**: Collection of useful code snippets, examples, and best practices related to MERN development.
