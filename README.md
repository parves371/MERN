# MERN Stack Learning Journey

Welcome to my MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack learning journey repository! This repository serves as a central hub for all the projects, code snippets, resources, and progress tracking related to my journey of mastering the MERN stack.

## About the MERN Stack

The MERN stack is a powerful combination of technologies for building modern web applications:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that provides scalability and flexibility, perfect for storing JSON-like documents.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its component-based architecture and virtual DOM.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, enabling server-side JavaScript execution.

## Repository Structure

- **Projects**: This directory contains subdirectories for individual MERN projects I'm working on. Each project will have its own folder containing the code, and any associated files.
- **Code Snippets**: Collection of useful code snippets, examples, and best practices related to MERN development.

# Node.js fs Module Examples

This README provides examples of common file system operations using Node.js `fs` module.

- [Reading Files](#reading-files)
- [Writing Files](#writing-files)
- [Appending to Files](#appending-to-files)
- [Renaming Files](#renaming-files)
- [Deleting Files](#deleting-files)

## 1. Reading Files

You can read the contents of a file using the `fs.readFile()` method.

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

fs.readFile("example.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data);
});
```

## 2. Writing Files:

To write data to a file, you can use the `fs.writeFile()` method.

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

const data = "Hello, world!";

fs.writeFile("example.txt", data, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log("Data written to file");
});
```

## 3. Appending to Files:

If you want to append data to an existing file, you can use the `fs.appendFile()` method.

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

const newData = "\nNew data to append";

fs.appendFile("example.txt", newData, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log("Data appended to file");
});
```

## 4. Renaming Files:

You can rename a file using the `fs.rename()` method.

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

fs.rename("oldFile.txt", "newFile.txt", (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log("File renamed successfully");
});
```

## 5. Deleting Files:

To delete a file, you can use the `fs.unlink()` method.

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

fs.unlink("example.txt", (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log("File deleted successfully");
});
```

These are just some basic examples of what you can do with the `fs` module in Node.js. There are many more methods available for handling files and directories.
